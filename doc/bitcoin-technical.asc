== 1.4.0 (29c3 release)
  - Initial release

== About

BTChip is a USB smartcard/dongle dedicated to secure bitcoin transactions. It performs all sensitive cryptographic operations related to a bitcoin transaction (key generation & signature) onboard, and helps protect against malware in an untrusted environment by controlling the signed data.

== User validation

BTChip allows you to validate what you sign - i.e. check that you are paying the right amount to the right destination.

User validation is performed as follows : 

  - A specific status is returned to inform the user that a validation is pending  
  - The user unplugs the dongle 
  - The user plugs the dongle back into the computer (or a different computer / smartphone, tablet with USB host support, depending on how confident you are about the first computer integrity)
  - The dongle "types" (as a keyboard) a summary of the action to be validated and a 4 digits PIN to be entered, which is unique to the transaction
  - The user plugs the dongle back into the first computer (or just unplugs / plugs it again)
  - The user enters the PIN to confirm user validation

== Operation modes

Operation modes define which operations are allowed given the security environment the dongle is operating in.

Four operation modes are defined :

  - standard-wallet mode, managing an HD Wallet (BIP 32) with multiple accounts, supporting payments to a single address and enforcing user validation of the full transaction. This mode is intended for all bitcoin users.
  - relaxed-wallet mode, managing an HD Wallet with multiple accounts, supporting arbitrary payments and enforcing user validation of the amount spent. This mode is intended for bitcoin users interested in drafting custom transactions with some level of control.
  - server mode, managing an HD Wallet with multiple accounts, supporting arbitrary payments and enforcing pre defined limits on the amount spent. This mode is intended for server operators using one or several BTChip dongles to secure their hot wallets.
  - developer mode, managing BIP 32 or regular private keys and allowing to sign arbitrary data. This mode is intended for bitcoin power users drafting custom transactions and only interested in private keys protection.

The dongle initally operates in standard-wallet mode when received. The last chosen mode is restored when the dongle is powered on.

=== standard-wallet mode

Only a single point-to-point output (i.e. the standard script or a P2SH script) along with one change address on the external chain is authorized. 

All transaction inputs are controlled by the dongle.

The change address index is automatically handled by the dongle and increased for each transaction to prevent address reuse. The change address index is shared for all accounts.

The standard script is coded as 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 [pubKeyHash] OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A P2SH script is coded as

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OP_HASH160 [script hash] OP_EQUAL
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transaction are controlled by the user validation process. The following data will be prompted to the user : 

  - Account index used
  - Amount to pay
  - Change amount
  - Fees

=== relaxed-wallet mode

Arbitrary output is authorized

Transaction inputs are only controlled if they use a key actually belonging to a wallet account.

Transaction are controlled by the user validation process. The following data will be prompted to the user : 

  - Account index used
  - Amount to pay
  - A large warning that relaxed-wallet mode is in use

=== server mode

Arbitrary output is authorized

Transaction inputs are only controlled if they use a key actually belonging to a wallet account.

Transactions are controlled given user parameters and automatically signed if accepted.

Transactions can be controlled on a combination of the following parameters :

  - A cumulative maximum amount used in transactions
  - A maximum number of consecutive transactions before the dongle is removed
  
=== developer mode

Arbitrary data can be signed in this mode

Keys used in developer mode cannot be used in a different mode

== Lifecycle management APDUs

=== SETUP

==== Description

This command is used to setup the dongle when received. It must be executed on a trusted computer as security critical data is exchanged. 

For a new dongle not used as a backup device, a regular user will create a new random seed for a HD wallet and a PIN.

The PIN is used to perform a new payment transaction - it is sent as cleartext to the dongle and is not intended to be used as a malware protection method, only as an anti theft security. 

After SETUP is performed, the dongle has to be reset to wipe out all parameters and start again - this can be achieved by entering the wrong PIN 3 times in a row.

A wipe PIN can be provided for plausible deniability - when entered instead of the regular user PIN, the seed is replaced by a random one and the device keeps operating.

It is recommended to store the BIP32 seed returned in the output of the SETUP command in a safe location for backup purposes - typically GPG encrypt it to yourself and store it on multiple storage devices / clouds.

When enabled, RFC 6979 deterministic signatures will be used for all operations in wallet, relaxed wallet and server modes, and will be optionally available in developer mode. 

NOTE: Using deterministic signatures will make the signing process slower and could possibly create a larger side channel attack surface due to the way private keys are handled during the computation of the random value. We suggest to only enable this mode if you don't trust the chip hardware Random Number Generator.

The following Key version are suggested for regular addresses

If generating a new seed, the dongle generates a 32 bytes random from its hardware Random Number Generator and performs an exclusive OR between this number and the provided user entropy to create the seed.

A keymap encoding is a set of Keyboard HID Usage IDs mapping the keyboard layout of the computer on which the user validation is performed. If several keymap encodings are provided, the user validation will be typed using all provided encodings, separated by a Carriage Return.

Each keymap encoding is coded as follows

==== Description

This command is used to unlock the dongle using the PIN provided during setup.

The dongle must be physically reset after each invalid PIN to issue a new command.

After 3 invalid PIN submitted in a row, the dongle data is erased and it must be setup again.

If the wipe PIN is entered instead of the user PIN, the device seed is replaced by a random one and the device keeps operating.

=== GET TRUSTED INPUT

==== Description

This command is used to extract a Trusted Input (encrypted transaction hash, output index, output amount) from a transaction. 

The transaction data to be provided should be encoded using bitcoin standard raw transaction encoding. Scripts can be sent over several APDUs. Other individual transaction elements split over different APDUs will be rejected. 64 bits varints are rejected.

=== UNTRUSTED HASH TRANSACTION INPUT START

==== Description

This command is used to compose an opaque SHA-256 hash for a new transaction.

This transaction can be verified by the user and using transaction rules according to the current dongle operation mode.

If a new transaction is started, a VERIFY PIN command shall have been issued previously to unlock the dongle at least once following the dongle power up

The transaction data to be provided should be encoded using bitcoin standard raw transaction encoded as follows :

  - A 1 byte flag is added before each input in the transaction - if the input will be signed in the transaction (not part of a partial transaction), this flag is set to 0x01
  - Each input outpoint for an input that will be signed in the transaction is to be replaced by the Trusted Input length (1 byte) and the Trusted Input data
  - The input scripts shall be prepared by the host for the transaction signing process as per bitcoin rules : the current input script being signed shall be the previous output script, and other input script shall be null
  - The encoded transaction data shall be provided up to (and not including) the number of outputs.
  - Scripts can be sent over several APDUs. Other individual transaction elements split over different APDUs will be rejected. 64 bits varints are rejected.
